## `Overview of the Amazon Vine Analysis`	
	
The purpose of the the project is to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin by using PySpark. Also, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset by using PySpark, Pandas, SQL.

The analysis consists the following: 
- Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews.
- Determine Bias of Vine Reviews.
- A Written Report on the Analysis.

## `Resources`	
The analysis is created using next software: Colaboratory (a hosted Jupyter notebook service), Visual Studio Code 1.58.0, PostgreSQL 11.12 and pgAdmin 5.5, AWS S3 and AWS RDS, Spark-3.0.3, Python 3.9.6.

## `The Amazon Vine Analysis Result`
### `- ETL on Amazon Product Reviews`	

Using the cloud ETL process, the AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin is created and, the dataset amazon_reviews_multilingual_FR from the Amazon Review datasets is picked and extracted into a DataFrame. Also, the DataFrame is transformed into four separate DataFrames that match the table schema in pgAdmin. 

The result of the ETL process on Amazon Product Reviews can be found in the [Amazon_Reviews_ETL](./Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb) file.

### `- Bias of Vine Reviews`
